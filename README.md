I'm a software engineer specializing in infrastructure and automation. My GitHub is mostly a place where I push code that I use to automate my personal homelab using tools like Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Ansible, and Terraform. I work mostly in the cloud professionally, but most things here involve running Kubernetes on Proxmox; and solving the many problems that involves.  You'll also find a few Python passion projects here to solve some of the more application-specific problems I've had. 

When I first started programming around 14, I told myself I would open source all of the code I ever wrote. (That isn't owned by an employer, obviously). Now that I'm much older and have been programming for longer than I haven't, I've mostly stuck to that vow. I don't see any reason I won't continue to do so. But that also means you'll probably find a lot of half-implemented projects and other broken windows here. You've been warned :sweat_smile:

Some of my personal hobbies include 3D printing, mountaineering, and trailrunning. You can also find me at the following places:
